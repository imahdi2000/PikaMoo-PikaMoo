## Data Description and Source

  The data we used is in JSON format and XML. It contains information about the Tube, DLR, and TfL Rail. The data has names of stations as well as expected arrival time. The data is also in real time because we are getting it from the Transport for London Unified API. It can be found here: https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/
  
## Relevance And Significance  
  
  We all hate waiting for the bus and train. That's why our website will allow you to see London's transportation system LIVE! Our European friends will surely find this tool useful in their daily ventures and so will you if you ever visit London. In addition, this also serves as a prototype for our NYC's transit system site, however their API needs work. Until then, we will explore London's bustling transit network!
  
## Making The Data Come Alive  

  Our data will literally be...a-LIVE! Pardon the pun. We are getting live data from the API which means we will be able to update the page with that live data. We want to have a D3 map of different routes and track each subway car/bus. The stations would be represented as large circles while vehicles will be represented as smaller circles moving along the route.
